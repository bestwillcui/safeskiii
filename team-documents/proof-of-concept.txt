The frontend structure is mostly done. The homepage includes a list of businesses, and for each one, info links, a broadcast bar, and comment/check-in sections. The comments section is reactive. Also, there's a nav bar that links to feed, info, settings, and logging out/login page. The info page (can change user settings) is linked to a backend. We're still working on the persistent database & some additional features (some of our team members had some extenuating circumstances outside of class).

We would appreciate any feedback on the current design/layout of the website. Also, any advice on what we should do to integrate the different areas, or if there's something we might be missing.
